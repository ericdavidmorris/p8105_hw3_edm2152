Problem 1
---------

Loading in the BRFSS Data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc)
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% 
  summarize(n_state = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_state == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state |  n\_state|
|:------|---------:|
| CT    |         7|
| FL    |         7|
| NC    |         7|

CT, FL and NC were observed at 7 locations.

Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_locations, color = state)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010, state =="NY") %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_excellent = sd(excellent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state |  year|  mean\_excellent|  sd\_excellent|
|:------|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
| NY    |  2002|         24.04000|       4.486424|
| NY    |  2006|         22.53333|       4.000833|
| NY    |  2010|         22.70000|       3.567212|

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.
