Problem 1
---------

Loading in the BRFSS Data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc)
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% 
  summarize(n_state = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_state == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state |  n\_state|
|:------|---------:|
| CT    |         7|
| FL    |         7|
| NC    |         7|

CT, FL and NC were observed at 7 locations.

Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_locations, color = state)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010, state =="NY") %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_excellent = sd(excellent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state |  year|  mean\_excellent|  sd\_excellent|
|:------|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
| NY    |  2002|         24.04000|       4.486424|
| NY    |  2006|         22.53333|       4.000833|
| NY    |  2010|         22.70000|       3.567212|

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_verygood = mean(very_good, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_good = mean(good, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_fair = mean(fair, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_poor = mean(poor, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gather(key = mean_variable, value = mean_value, mean_excellent:mean_poor) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_value, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~mean_variable)   
```

Problem 2
---------

Instacart Data Import

``` r
instacart_data = instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
  
unique_users = instacart_data %>% 
  distinct(user_id) %>% 
  nrow()

distinct_dept = instacart_data %>% 
  distinct(department) %>% 
  nrow()

distinct_products = instacart_data %>% 
  distinct(product_id) %>% 
  nrow()
```

In the instacart dataset there are 15 variables including identifiers for aisle, order, product and customer. The instacart dataset also includes 1384617 observations which is equivalent to a product from an order. There are 131209 unique users in the dataset that submitted an order, 21 distinct departments that recieved an order, and 39123 distinct products ordered.

To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

-   How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

-   Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle. Order aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

-   Make a table showing the most popular item in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.

-   Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
